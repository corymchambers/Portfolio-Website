			 <h1>Intern Work</h1><br>
			 <p>My first internship with <a href="http://www.think-safe.com/" target="new">Think Safe Inc</a> was from May to August in 2012 and during this time I created and edited Web sites for the company but most of my time was spent working on an update in software for a hardware device called the EID or Emergency Information Device. I followed a series of flow charts that were given to me and used to them to make changes to the current model that would reflect the update request. This project gave me experiene with <strong class="key">flowcharts, programming logic, and writing pseudocode</strong>. Once the programming code was updated it was transferred to a SD card that was inputed into the hardware device for operation. I spent many hours testing the device by running it through every possible simulation to ensure that the device opearted properly. Below is a picture of the hardware device and if you click on it you will be taken to a demo of the device.</p>

			 <p>My second internship was June to September of 2013 and in that time I mostly made changes to a Program Manager System. Information about the Program Manager can be found <a href="http://ps.firstvoice.us/FV-Manager-Product-Description.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. The system is used to easily manage and track each AED and corresponding First Voice or first aid supplies within their facilities from any computer with internet access. I made changes to the front end of the system with <strong class="key">HTML and CSS</strong> and then made changes to the back end as well with <strong class="key">PHP and MySQL</strong></p>
